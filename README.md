# A tutorial on how to debloat a Xiaomi phone running MIUI 12 or lower.  

## The complete tutorial is in the [xiaomiDebloat.md](https://github.com/mnjx/xiaomiDebloat/blob/main/xiaomiDebloat.md) file.

*Note that this tutorial may work even for phones with MIUI version higher than 12. It may not remove all the bloatware, but it should remove the majority of the unwanted apps.*
